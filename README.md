## Hearing And Speech Nova Scotia Frontend

Welcome

To run the frontend of our project you will need to follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the code
2. cd into the directory on your local machine
3. Run the command "npm install" (might need to have npm installed on your machine)
4. Run the command "npm run dev" to start the application
5. If the backend has been taken down due to AWS charges, you will have to host the code on your machine as well and change the api url in src > api > api.js to your localhost
6. When asked to login use email: admin@gmail.com and password: 1
